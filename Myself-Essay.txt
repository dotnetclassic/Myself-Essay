Myself

My name is Muhammad Imran, and I am a 43 year old Web Developer. I was born and raised in Faisalabad, a place that has greatly influenced who I am today.

From a young age, I have always been fascinated by gaming, sports and technology. This interest has shaped much of my life and career choices. I pursued my passion for Web Development by studying new technologies at university and my professional field, where I gained a solid foundation in programming  skills.

Currently, I work as a web developer. Over the past decade, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients, including a long-term project that spanned more than fifteen years. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of perseverance, adaptability, and building strong professional relationships.

Aside from my professional life, I am deeply interested in Islam and reciting Quran. In my free time, I enjoy walking, exercise and give time to my family, which help me relax and recharge. I also believe in continuous learning and often spend time exploring new technologies and trends in web development to stay updated.
