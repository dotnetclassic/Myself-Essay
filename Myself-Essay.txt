Myself

My name is Muhammad Imran, and I am a 43 year old Web Developer. I was born and raised in Faisalabad, a place that has greatly influenced who I am today.

From a young age, I have always been fascinated by gaming, sports and technology. This interest has shaped much of my life and career choices. I pursued my passion for Web Development by studying new technologies at university and my professional field, where I gained a solid foundation in programming  skills.
